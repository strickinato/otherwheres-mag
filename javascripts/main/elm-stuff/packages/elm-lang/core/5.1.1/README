<h1 id="elm-core-libraries">Elm Core Libraries</h1>

<p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/elm-lang/core"><img alt="Build Status" src="https://travis-ci.org/elm-lang/core.svg?branch=master" /></a></p>

<p>Every Elm project needs the core libraries. They provide basic functionality including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Basics — addition, subtraction, etc.</li>
  <li>Data Structures — lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="default-imports">Default Imports</h2>

<p>All Elm files have some default imports:</p>

<p>```elm
import Basics exposing (..)
import List exposing ( List, (::) )
import Maybe exposing ( Maybe( Just, Nothing ) )
import Result exposing ( Result( Ok, Err ) )
import String
import Tuple</p>

<p>import Debug</p>

<p>import Platform exposing ( Program )
import Platform.Cmd exposing ( Cmd, (!) )
import Platform.Sub exposing ( Sub )
```</p>

<p>The intention is to include things that are both extremely useful and very
unlikely to overlap with anything that anyone will ever write in a library.
By keeping the set of default imports small, it also becomes easier to use
whatever version of <code>map</code> suits your fancy. Finally, it makes it easier to
figure out where the heck a function is coming from.</p>
